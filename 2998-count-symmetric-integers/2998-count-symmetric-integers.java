/**
Approach 1: Enumeration
Intuition
Enumerate all numbers from low to high:

1. If it is a two-digit number and is a multiple of 11, then it is a symmetric integer.
2. If it is a four-digit number, calculate the sum of the thousands and hundreds digits, as well as the sum of the tens and ones digits. If they are equal, it is a symmetric (even) integer.
Finally, it returns the number of symmetric integers in the range.

Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(highâˆ’low).
We enumerate all numbers from low to high and check whether they are symmetric integers in O(1) each time.

Space complexity: O(1).
Only a few additional variables are needed.
