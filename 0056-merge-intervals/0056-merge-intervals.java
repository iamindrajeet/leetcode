/* 
 * Approach:
 * 1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
 * 2. Use a greedy approach to iterate through the intervals:
 *    - If the current interval overlaps with the previous one, merge them by updating the end
        time.
 *    - Otherwise, add the current interval to the result list.
 * 3. Convert the list of merged intervals back to an array and return.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.
 * - The iteration through the intervals takes O(n).
 * - Overall TC: O(n log n).
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - The merged list takes up O(n) space in the worst case (when no intervals overlap).
 * - The sorting operation uses O(log n) space due to the sorting algorithm.
 * - Overall SC: O(n).
